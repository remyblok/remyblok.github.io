<h1>Hello there!</h1>
<div class="profile-pic"><img alt="Me, a long, long time ago..." src="/assets/images/profile_pic.jpg"></div>
<p>I'm Remy Blok. J is from my middle name, forming a nice RJB. Not to be confused with RGB...I know its all the hype, I stick with purple.</p>
<p>They say I'm a Software Architect, but hostestly I'm more a software tinkerer. I love just playing around and new stuff and finding boundaries and trying to go beyond. While doing that I actually do try to make workable software. I find solutions for problems you never knew you had, or maybe you did and that's why you ended up here at my blog.</p>
<p>Currenyly I work for [Prodware](https://www.prodware.nl) in The Netherlands. I've been working here for more than 15 years! When I started I'd never written a line of C#, because at school I leared Java. But I learned quickly enough! C#, WinForms, Asp.net, WPF, WCF, Asp.Net MVC, and all the standards and technologies that come with those stacks. Gradually I shifted more to integration and back-end systems. First with BizTalk, later with all the goodies Azure has to offer.</p>
<p>Nowadays I'm again shifting focus more to the Power Platform. Prodware is afterall the No. 1 Microsoft Dynamics 365 Partner in Europe. The Power Platform is a big part of that, and is becomming more important for us every day. Eveything is moving pretty fast on the Power Platform, with many new features rolling out continuesly. So many opportunities for me to tinker around. My goal is to share some of the good stuff with you!</p>

<p>So, yeah, I'm quite a bit your regular nerd. I love Star Wars. I'm typing this in a room filled with books, adorned with my Lightsaber collection, while Grogu is adorably looking at me. But I have some Wands from Harry Potter too. And on my wall is art from the Lion King and Frozen. It is all so much fun!</p>
<p>When I'm not nerding out, I like to go to the cinema or go see (clasical) concert. Seeing Hans Zimmer live was one of the most epic experiences ever. Such great music and performance. Also walking takes a good amount of my time. Whether it is just outside my home or somewere far off, walking is my preferred method of transportation (let's not talk about trains...)</p>
<p>But my heart truely want to travel the world. I've discovered the joys of traveling a few years ago. Once you've seen beautiful places, like Agentina, Cuba, Easter Island, Iceland, two tings happen. One, you want to go back. Two, you want to see more other places. My bucket list is overflowing of places to travel too. </p>
