Title: How can you harness the full potential of Microsoft Power Apps?
---

Microsoft positions Power Apps as a Low Code platform for creating Apps. Power Apps is part of the Power Platform, which includes Power BI, Power Automate and Dataverse, all Low Code solutions.

On the other hand, Microsoft is also advocating for Fusion Development teams. These are teams that consist of citizen developers, consultants, but also .Net and Web developers. The type of developers that are normally not focused on Low Code but create High Code solutions.

In this article we look at Microsoft Power Apps and the range of possibilities it offers in its toolbox. Plus, what you can do with Low Code development and what the ‘upgrade’ paths are, including High Code solutions, to create an App that meets your requirements.

## What is a Model-driven Power App? 
Let’s start with a Model-driven app. This is the most Low Code app that is available in the toolbox. As the name implies, it is driven by the model. In this context that means the data model of Dataverse. So, the model we create in Dataverse drives how our App behaves. Dataverse gives us the first extension point for our App.

A Model-driven app consists of a menu, or sitemap as it is called. Each menu item is linked to a Page. There are three kinds of pages: Dashboards, Tables and Canvas Pages. So, for each menu option you can decide what is the best kind of page to fulfill the requirements.

With Dashboards it is possible to create overviews of your data to quickly access it. Or you can add charts and graphs for a visual representation. 
Tables are direct views on your tables in Dataverse. In Dataverse you can design how the data is represented in lists and forms. Forms have some interesting extension points for custom UI controls. 

Last is the Canvas Page. You may have heard of Canvas Apps in the context of Power Apps. Canvas Pages is Canvas Apps, the only difference is that instead of a complete App it is just one page. With Canvas Pages we can create a custom UI to interact with the data. This is also the last extension point we look at.
